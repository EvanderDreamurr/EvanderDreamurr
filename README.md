## Welcome to my worlds!

I have created worlds through the magic of games to let others escape and find comfort. 

I am a solo developer with most of my work being in game jams for 6 years. One such jam was Ludum Dare ran by Mike Kasprzak. I have worked with Unity and Godot using C# and gd script (which is based on python).

I'm currently working on my personal game project "Green Growth" (working title). I have the foundation of code done and now I'm working on the terrain in blender.
